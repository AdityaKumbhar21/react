 let increaseValue = ()=>{
      setCounter(counter+1)   
  } 

 Here in this function interviewer may ask:
     let increaseValue = ()=>{
      setCounter(counter+1)
      setCounter(counter+1)
      setCounter(counter+1)
      setCounter(counter+1)
      setCounter(counter+1)

        NOW WHAT WILL BE THE VALUE OF COUNTER:  value will be 16
        REASON:
            As react executes using fiber the operations are sent in the form of batch and the lates one only gets executed.
  }

  If you want to update value to directly four we can do
   let increaseValue = ()=>{
      setCounter((prevCounter)=> prevCounter + 1)   
      setCounter((prevCounter)=> prevCounter + 1)   
      setCounter((prevCounter)=> prevCounter + 1)   
      setCounter((prevCounter)=> prevCounter + 1)   

      HERE THE PREVIOUS COUNTER IS RECEIEVED TO THE FUNCTION AND AFTER THE FINCTION GETS EXECUTED THE NEXT CALL IS MADE
