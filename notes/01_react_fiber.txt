What is react Fiber?
    React Fiber is a well implemented algorithm for reconciliation, that is compare trees of DOM and react DOM and make changes accordingly

    Functions:
        1. pause work and come back to it later.
        2. assign priority to different types of work.
        3. reuse previously completed work.
        4. abort work if it's no longer needed.

What is reconciliation?
    The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
    Reconciliation is nothing but the algorithm used behind the scenes of Virtual DOM
